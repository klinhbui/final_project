 ## Overview
 This project builds and analyzes a graph representation of a dataset of books. The graph is constructed using relationships between books based on attributes such as shared authors, similar average ratings, number of pages, publishers, ratings count, and text review count. The goal is to identify patterns, clusters, and significant connections in the dataset to create a recommendation map of similar books that people that are similar to each other.
